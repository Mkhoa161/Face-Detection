# Real-Time Face Detection with Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a **real-time face detection** system using **deep learning** techniques. By leveraging transfer learning from the pre-trained **VGG16** model, the system is capable of detecting faces in live video streams and localizing their positions within the frame. The model was trained with a combination of image collection, annotation, data processing, augmentation, and fine-tuning to deliver an accurate face detection solution.

The project involves the use of **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Keras** to implement the deep learning model, alongside custom loss functions for both classification and localization tasks.

Real-Time Face Detection with Deep Learning
This project focuses on building a real-time face detection system using deep learning techniques. By leveraging transfer learning from the pre-trained VGG16 model, the system is capable of detecting faces in live video streams and localizing their positions within the frame. The model was trained with a combination of image collection, annotation, data processing, augmentation, and fine-tuning to deliver an accurate face detection solution.

The project involves the use of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Keras to implement the deep learning model, alongside custom loss functions for both classification and localization tasks.

## Key Features

- **Real-time face detection**: Detects faces in live video streams.
- **Face localization**: Provides the bounding box coordinates for detected faces.
- **Transfer learning**: Utilizes the VGG16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction.
- **Custom deep learning model**: Combines face classification and localization in a single model.
- **Efficient training**: Uses custom loss functions and the train_step method to optimize the model effectively.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Can be run on any platform that supports OpenCV and TensorFlow, including local machines and embedded systems.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is built on top of the **VGG16** network for feature extraction and is enhanced with a custom head for **classification** and **localization**. The architecture consists of:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size (120, 120, 3).
2. **VGG16 Backbone**: Uses the convolutional layers of VGG16 with `include_top=False`, which means we discard the fully connected layers and use the convolutional part as a feature extractor.
3. **Global Max Pooling**: Reduces the output of the convolutional layers to a fixed-size vector.
4. **Dense Layers for Classification**: A fully connected dense layer with 2048 units followed by a final sigmoid activation for binary classification (face or no face).
5. **Dense Layers for Localization**: Another dense layer with 2048 units, followed by a final layer with 4 units to predict the bounding box coordinates of the face.
